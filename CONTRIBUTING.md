## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```

### Testing

We use Cypress for component testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run cy:run

# Open Cypress UI
npm run cy:open
```

## üìù Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper generic constraints
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing instead

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Follow React best practices

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Components**: PascalCase
- **Functions**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Component Testing

- Test all field components thoroughly
- Test form validation scenarios
- Test accessibility features
- Test responsive behavior
- Use realistic test data

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test basic rendering
  });

  it('should handle user interactions', () => {
    // Test user interactions
  });

  it('should validate input correctly', () => {
    // Test validation
  });

  it('should be accessible', () => {
    // Test accessibility
  });
});
```
